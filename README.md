# Mini-Full-Stack-Project
A project to teach an overview of an Full Stack Application. 

This project was used to develop my understanding of full stack programming in the development of my university project (see Uni-Project Repo). 
This project allowed me to continue to develop my core web dev skills such as JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This project also taught me the following â€“
-	How to use React 
-	How to use databases and APIs to store /recall data. 
-	Advanced CSS 
-	Using forms in React 
-	Deploying to Netlify
